INT. MR. DARCY'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

The tension between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet reaches its peak. Mr. Darcy, with an air of superiority, criticizes Elizabeth's appearance.

MR. DARCY
Miss Elizabeth, I must be honest with you. While your wit and intelligence are commendable, your appearance is not particularly striking.

Elizabeth raises an eyebrow and smirks in response.

ELIZABETH
Oh, Mr. Darcy, how fortunate I am to have your candid assessment of my looks. I was losing sleep over it.

Mr. Darcy, undeterred, continues with his critique.

MR. DARCY
I believe it is only fair to be truthful. One should not shy away from expressing one's opinions, no matter how uncomfortable they may be.

Elizabeth leans in, fixing Mr. Darcy with an intense gaze.

ELIZABETH
Well, Mr. Darcy, it appears you're quite the expert on honesty today. Allow me to reciprocate.

She takes a deep breath, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
You, sir, may not be the most charming of gentlemen. In fact, your arrogance is rather astounding. And if we're being perfectly candid, you're not exactly the most handsome man I've ever encountered.

Mr. Darcy, surprised by her boldness, shifts uncomfortably. Elizabeth, however, isn't finished.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
But let me assure you, Mr. Darcy, your looks are not the reason I find myself disliking you. It's your character – or lack thereof – that truly repels me.

Suddenly, the ground trembles as the room shakes. Elizabeth grins mischievously and heads towards the window. Outside, a colossal robot, hidden behind the estate, rises into view. Elizabeth turns back to Mr. Darcy with determination.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Mr. Darcy, if you insist on challenging my appearance and character, then I propose we settle this in a manner befitting such a grand spectacle.

She dramatically gestures to the giant robot, and the cockpit opens. Elizabeth confidently climbs in, securing herself inside the machine.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Prepare yourself, Mr. Darcy. It's time for a duel of both wits and mechs.

Mr. Darcy, bewildered by the unexpected turn of events, watches as the massive robot flexes its metallic limbs. The challenge has been set, and the duel between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy is about to unfold in an extraordinary fashion.
